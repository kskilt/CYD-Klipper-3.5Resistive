# CYD-Klipper
An implementation of a wireless Klipper, Bambu and Octoprint status display on an ESP32 + screen. Uses Moonraker to fetch data.

A simple and cheap solution to use a dedicated screen with Klipper, a 3d printing Firmware.
Also now with Bambu Lab and Octoprint printers!

### Required hardware

A ESP32-2432S028R is required to run this project. You can find out where to buy these on the ["ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display"](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display#where-to-buy) repository.

### Features
- View printer status
- View print progress and print statistics
- Start a print
- (When the printer is idle) move the printer
- (During a print) set fan speed, flow rate, speed and z offset
- Manage temperature
- Extrude/Retract filament
- Execute predefined gcode macros
- Toggle Moonraker power devices
- OTA updates
- Serial console over USB (115200 8n1, echo off, LF/LF)
- Control Klipper, Octoprint and Bambu printers.
- Wired Serial/Usb Klipper connection

### Install

[There is a web-based installer available. This is only supported on Chrome, Edge, Arc or Opera, and only on Desktop.](https://suchmememanyskill.github.io/CYD-Klipper/)

On initial install, all data should be wiped. On updates, data should be able to be kept without issues.

When there is an update available, a button in the settings will appear that can be pressed to update. If automatic updates are preferred, there is a toggle in the settings to automatically update. This will right after connecting to wifi update the screen.

### Donate

If you found this project helpful, please consider a donation [to my Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/suchmememanyskill). It would help out a lot in the development of this project, due to the need to buy the screens. 

Thank you!
